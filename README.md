# RAG Infra â€“ Azure GitOps Control Layer

**Azure | AKS | Kubernetes | GitOps | Argo CD | CI/CD | Platform Architecture | Declarative Infrastructure**

This repository governs the **GitOps control plane** for the Azure RAG Platform.  
It defines the reproducible pattern of **declarative application delivery** into AKS, with Argo CD orchestrating Kubernetes workloads at scale.

> A delivery system by design â€” professional, reproducible, and structured to extend into multi-service platform operations.

ðŸ”— **Part of the full project:**  â†’ [azure-gitops-platform](https://github.com/dhayv/azure-gitops-platform)

---

## ðŸ§± Structure

- **Namespace** â†’ isolates the RAG application (`ragapp`)  
- **Deployment** â†’ FastAPI app with replicas + health checks  
- **Service** â†’ exposes the app internally and via LoadBalancer  
- **Secrets** â†’ manages Azure credentials for RAG integration  
- **Argo CD Root App** â†’ directs this repo declaratively into AKS

## ðŸ§  Why This Repo?

Most engineers ship pipelines. **Fewer design the control layer that governs delivery.**  
This repo shows how to own **what ships, when, and how** â€” with Git as the source of truth, Argo CD as the orchestrator, and AKS as the execution platform.  

It marks the shift from executor to **platform operator and architect**.

## ðŸš€ Responsibilities

- âœ… Installs and configures **Argo CD** in AKS  
- âœ… Deploys the RAG API into a dedicated namespace  
- âœ… Owns manifests for Deployment, Service, Namespace, and Secrets  
- âœ… Directs the **GitOps reconciliation loop**: Git â†’ Argo CD â†’ AKS  

---

## ðŸ§ª Roadmap

- Extend into **App-of-Apps orchestration** for rag-infra + rag-app separation  
- Introduce **Helm chart packaging** to manage versioned rollouts  
- Expand repo to govern **multi-app deployments** beyond ragapp

## ðŸ“Œ Takeaway

This repo is the **GitOps control entry point** for the Azure RAG Platform.  
It governs delivery with **declarative manifests + Argo CD orchestration**, structured to scale into multi-service, multi-environment operations.  

A delivery system, owned declaratively, and architected for forward growth.
